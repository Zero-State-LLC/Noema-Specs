# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Canonical NOEMA persistent MUD multi-agent specification baseline.
- Exact required protocol documents for MUD commands, agent protocol, event ledger, and replay.
- Ten requested Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema files and matching examples.
- Lowercase research ontology, controls, claims, and ethics files.
- RFC README and template for contract-changing decisions.
- `validation/` merge-gate suite (structure, JSON parse, link check, claim-label scan).
- `adr/` directory with five foundational ADRs (determinism, private cognition, claim labels, world-truth isolation, v0.1 equivalence boundary).
- `docs/SECURITY-SEQUENCES.md` — concrete containment, quarantine, revocation, incident, kill-switch, and undelivered-observation sequences.
- `docs/v0.1-ACCEPTANCE.md` — operational acceptance criteria and minimum conformance tests for The Chamber.
- `docs/CONTRACT-CARDS.md` — progressive-disclosure summaries of major contracts.
- `docs/INTEGRATION-SURFACE.md` — explicit extension points for Zero State / Abraxas ecosystem consumers.
- `research/phenomena-operational-definitions.md` — operational definitions, required data, confounds, and limits for the five high-signal constructs.
- `examples/negative/` — invalid fixtures for schema, catalog, and semantic rejection testing.
- `examples/v01-seed/` — concrete Chamber seed: world genesis, full 24-type trajectory, equivalence boundary, and expected digests.
- `.github/workflows/spec-validation.yml` — CI validation gate.

### Changed

- Reframed all core docs from an agent-centered research-apparatus baseline to the requested autonomous-agent research apparatus.
- Reinforced claim-label and consciousness-score policy through ADR-003 and operational definitions.
- Made v0.1 equivalence boundary explicit and mandatory via ADR-005.
- Strengthened `validation/validate_all.py` to enforce structure, env docs, seed catalog coverage, digest chain, and negative corpus rejection.

### Removed

- Thought-centric protocol, schema, and example artifacts that were inconsistent with NOEMA.

### Notes

- Spec checklist structure, contract quality, and tree validation items are checked. A `0.1.0` tag still waits on green CI on `main` and an independent World Engine replay of `examples/v01-seed/`.
